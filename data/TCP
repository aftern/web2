This is a list of TCP and UDP port numbers used bu protocols for operation of network applications.
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) only need one port for duplex, bidirectional traffic.
They usually use port numbers that match the services of the corresponding TCP or UDP implementation, if they exist.
